/* README FIRST */
// This program is a simple demo that demonstrates the RegisteredTraceEventParser to look at OS events
// in real time.   Now many of the events that you might be interested in are in the Kernel event
// source (see 3*_Kernel*) samples where you sue the KernelTraceEventParser.  Please see the 
// TraceEvent Programmers guide (In the TraceEvent NuGet package or one the web) for more 
//
// The basic flow of the program is
//     * Create a 'real time' TraceEventSession.  This lets you control what events you wish to collect
//     * Connect a ETWTraceEventSource for the session using the 'Source' property.   A TraceEventSource 
//           represents the stream of events coming from the session.  
//     * Connect a TraceEventParser to the source.    Parsers know how to interpret events from particular 
//          ETW providers.  In this case we care about non-kernel OS events and the RegisteredTraceEventParser
//          is the parser that knows how to decode the events.   
//     * Attach callbacks to the Parser for the events you are interested in.  We use the 'All' C# event 
//          for this.  
//     * Enable the ETW providers of interest (in this case Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File provider) despite
//          its name it is NOT part of the kernel provider, but is a 'normal' user mode provider that 
//          supplies much of the same information as FILE keyword on the kernel provider.   
//     * Call the ETWTraceEventSource.Process() method, which waits for events and sends them to the callbacks. 
//     * At this point callbacks get called when the events come in.  
//     
// After 'Process()' is called, it will return if
//     * The TraceEventSession.Dispose() is called.

                //
                // To help avoid this by default TraceEventSession sets 'StopOnDispose' so that it will stop

                //     * use the same session name (say your program name) run-to-run so you don't create many orphans.
