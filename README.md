IMPORTANT:
-Make sure to run the launcher after opening the game, PresentMon doesn't seem to like being run before the game is loaded.
-Make sure to install in C:\PresentMonLauncher (default) otherwise the program won't run PresentMon.


Installer includes a built copy of PresentMon already, along with all supporting files.
Installer also includes a built copy of AdoredTV's presentmonbencher application.

Massive thank you to Daniel T. Holtzclaw for helping imporove the launcher, check him out here: https://sites.google.com/site/danielscompendium/pro

I make no claim on PresentMon or it's copyright. This includes a built copy of PresentMon, but done so in good faith with no intention of resale.
