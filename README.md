IMPORTANT: Make sure to run the launcher after opening the game, PresentMon doesn't seem to like being run before the game is loaded.

You should now be able to install this anywhere and it will find itself just fine. C:\PresentMonLauncher is still recommended for easy access/updating, but now not required.


Installer includes a built copy of PresentMon already, along with all supporting files.
Installer also includes a built copy of AdoredTV's presentmonbencher application.

Ridiculously massive thank you to Daniel T. Holtzclaw for helping improve the launcher and rewriting the bencher application to C#, check him out here: https://sites.google.com/site/danielscompendium/pro

Thank you to h0rnman for adding some more validation especially of the checkboxes! Check him out here: https://github.com/h0rnman and https://veryposh.wordpress.com/

I make no claim on PresentMon or it's copyright. This includes a built copy of PresentMon, but done so in good faith with no intention of resale.
