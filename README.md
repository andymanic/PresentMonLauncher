

IMPORTANT: Make sure to run the launcher after opening the game, PresentMon doesn't seem to like being run before the game is loaded.

External packages are excluded by the .gitignore file.  You will need to manually install the following NuGet packages:

*  Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent
*  Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEventSamples
*  Newtonsoft.Json
*  Rx-Core
*  Rx-Interfaces
*  Rx-Linq
*  Rx-Main
*  Rx-PlatformServices

You should now be able to install this anywhere and it will find itself just fine. C:\PresentMonLauncher is still recommended for easy access/updating, but now not required.

Installer includes a built copy of PresentMon already, along with all supporting files.
